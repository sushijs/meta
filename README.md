# Meta SushiJS
> the repo behind the repos

Please create a GitHub Issue on this repository for anything related to SushiJS generally, for example, to ask for the creation of a new repository for your local chapter of SushiJS.

We use GitHub (this website!) to discuss things. If you're not used to that, here's a [quick video intro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlrJVSJRUN4).

## Fork (chopstick?) a SushiJS in Your City

Please open an issue on this repo and clearly state:

- **the github usernames of everyone who should be an admin on the repo**.
  We find that having at least 2 is best, but if it's just you, that's fine for now.
- **the name of the repo**.
  This becomes the URL slug, eg `sushijs/foo`. 
  If your city has a short name, like an airport code, that's fine.
  Whatever you like that's still recognizable as your city.

Once you have a repository created, encourage people in your town to "watch" the repo to subscribe to notifications for issues on GitHub.
Issues are a great way to propose, plan, and remind people of upcoming events.
Filling out a README, description, and optional URL to your repo will help people know what's going on and want to come to your cool event.
Feel free to borrow text and formatting from other SushiJS repos.

## Get Help Organizing

A great way is to open an issue, or browse through some of the repositories from other cities to see what they're up to.

## Code of Conduct

All events, activities, and internet spaces which bear the SushiJS name are subject to the [SushiJS Code of Conduct](CODEOFCONDUCT.md).
Simply stated, harassment of any form will not be tolerated and should be reported to your local organizer or to terinjokes@gmail.com.
Please act in a way that honors the community values of respect and mutual enrichment which we share.

## Why Organize on GitHub?

See this thread from a local BeerJS chapter: https://github.com/beerjs/abq/issues/6

## Contact

To the extent that anyone "runs" SushiJS, it's these folks:

- @terinjokes, local internet comedian

The best way to get in touch with one of us is through the issues on this repo.

cheers & sushi! :sushi:
